                <p>we've been making irresistible, award-winning ice cream for over 10 years, so we think we're pretty
                    good at it. But you should try for yourself -tasting is believing!</p>
                <p>we think ice cream should be enjoyed whatever the weather so we're open all year round. whether you
                    want something devilishly delicious at halloween oor a sundae on a summer day come and visit us!</p>
                <p>it's our mission to create amazing plant based products that push you to think about plants like you
                    never have before. throught crafting an icecream from oats, rather than diary, we belive we can
                    achieve an ice cream alternative with creamier texture and bolder flavour.
                    we belive in the potenitial of canadian agriculture, the rich history of grain in the region, the
                    vital nutrients that leave us feeling full and nourished. we deeply repect conservationof our land
                    and belive this repect is carried over into flavour and taste of food. the more time and care put
                    into the growing and harvesting of ingredients, the better the overall quality.
                </p>
                <p>ice cream is a dietary source of two important minerals. it is particularly rich in calcium and
                    phosphorus, with about 10 percent of the ault recommended dietary allowance, or RDA, of these
                    minerals in a single, one half-cup of serving . that's why life is better with icecream.
